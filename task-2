I wanted to create a system that, after inputting the day, would then either go down the discounted route or the standard pricing
So was going to use an ifElse split to determine the discount but could not get it to functionally progress after the decision
Also need to implement some form of user input in this section ideally.*/

/*at this point I was aiming to implement a user input section that allowed a selection of ticket(s) that would produce a total.
I need to implement a system here that can determine if the prices are correct for the day of the week and then print the result,
allowing the customer to see the price. I wanted to finish the project with another small section of user input that would print
a phrase along the lines of "thank you for your purchase, enjoy!".*/
